<ul>
  <li>7 April 2014:<ul>
    <li>Exploits avoiding the maximum limits for game options have been fixed. No more games with
    9001 blank white cards.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>23 February 2014:<ul>
    <li>Some minor bugfixes, including one which should prevent the entire server from dying if a
    single background task gets stuck.</li>
    <li>Some minor performance improvements.</li>
    <li><a href="http://houseofcardsagainsthumanity.com/">House of Cards Against Humanity</a> is now
    available.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>26 January 2014:<ul>
    <li>Several bugs have been fixed:<ul>
      <li><strong>Games should no longer reset when an idle player is kicked.</strong></li>
      <li>The judge should no longer have to re-judge when a player leaves during judging.</li>
      <li>The playing field should no longer visibly blank out when a player joins or leaves.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>The game host has a "stop game" button. If this is abused, it may be changed to only work
    in the first few rounds of a game.</li>
    <li>You can filter which games to display based on what card sets they are using. Under the
    Game List Filters tab, you can assign each card set to one of three statuses: Banned, Neutral,
    and Required. If a game uses <strong>any</strong> of your banned sets, it will not be shown. If
    a game does not use <strong>all</strong> of your required sets, it also will not be shown.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>22 December 2013:<ul>
    <li>What I have received so far of the Holiday Bullshit has been added. I will continue to add
    cards to this as I receive them.</li>
    <li>Several custom card sets have been added.</li>
    <li><strong>No further custom card sets will be accepted.</strong> Minor updates to existing
    ones may still be submitted, but I do not guarantee I will get to it in a timely manner. It is
    taking too much of my time to administer the custom cards sets; I'd rather focus the time on
    implementing a way for players to manage card sets in the game by themselves.</li>
    <li>Fixed a memory leak introduced in the last update that causes the server to massively slow
    down after a few days of running.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>1 December 2013 Mega-Update:<ul>
    <li>There are a <strong>lot</strong> of new things this time around. You can view the
    <a href="https://github.com/ajanata/PretendYoureXyzzy/commits/master">GitHub commit history</a>
    for full details, but here's a summary:<ul>
      <li>Spectator mode. The host can pick how many spectators the shall allow. Spectators do not
      participate in the game at all, even as Card Czar.</li>
      <li>Fill-in-the-blank White Cards. The host can pick how many of these to shuffle into the
      deck, and when they are played, you are prompted for the text to put on the card.</li>
      <li>/me chat command for emotes.</li>
      <li>Option to disable bouncy cards. We've all had a problem selecting the last card on the
      line; well now, you can uncheck a box up at the top right and they'll stop bouncing around.</li>
      <li>/sync chat command to re-sync the current game state without reloading the page. It should
      be harder to de-sync the client now, as well.</li>
      <li>Users are removed from the server if they have not done anything for an hour.</li>
      <li>Several more bug fixes and back-end improvements.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>The Fourth Expansion is up.</li>
    <li>As you have probably noticed in getting here, there is now a meta-lobby which allows you to
    choose between multiple servers. They should be identical other than the people playing on them:
    they are backed by the same card database.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>5 September 2013:<ul>
    <li tabindex="0">The Box Expansion and PAX Prime 2013 cards have been added. <strong>If you have
    any spares of these card numbers and are willing to part with them, it would be awesome if you'd
    <a href="mailto:ajanata@socialgamer.net?subject=13PAX+cards">email me</a> and send them to me,
    as I was unable to acquire them at PAX:</strong> 29, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>7 August 2013:<ul>
    <li tabindex="0"><strong>The game list will not automatically update all the time now.</strong>
    You will need to start using the Refresh Games button. The game list will automatically update
    for new games, removed games, when games become passworded, or when you leave a game.</li>
    <li tabindex="0">A lot of custom card sets have been added.</li>
    <li tabindex="0">Cleaned up some error handling.</li>
    <li tabindex="0">Tried to fix some more of the server crashes.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>28 April 2013:<ul>
    <li tabindex="0">Version 1.3 of the base Cards Against Humanity game.</li>
    <li tabindex="0">Card sets are grouped by official or custom.</li>
    <li tabindex="0">You can <a href="viewcards.jsp">view all of the cards in the game</a>,
    including searching by text and filtering card set.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>20 April 2013:<ul>
    <li>A bunch of accessibility things for screen readers. If you are not using a
    screen reader, you don't care about any of this. If you are, tab to the next element for more
    information.
      <div style="position:absolute; left:-999999px" tabindex="0" id="screenreader-intro">
      I have spent a couple hours attempting to make this usable with screen readers. I have probably
      missed a few things, but I believe the game is actually playable now. You should be able to get
      to all of the interactive elements using only tab and shift tab, and all toggles should respond
      to the space bar. To select a card, tab to it and press the space bar. You will have to get to
      the Confirm Selection button to actually play it. I may eventually remove this requirement if
      the card is selected with the space bar. The list of games leaves some information that is
      visible out in an attempt to prevent each game from requiring a minute to read. You can still
      access that information by navigating through the elements directly. I attempted to make the
      notifications not be too chatty, but I may have failed. Please let me know if there are any
      major issues.
      </div>
    </li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>14 April 2013:<ul>
    <li>Fixed the game list sometimes showing the same game over and over, and not loading the list
    of card sets to display in game options.</li>
    <li>Made game list cards bigger, and fixed HTML entities displayed in them.</li>
    <li>Fixed even-numbered rows in the scoreboard not using the correct background color when
    displaying that the person won.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>13 April 2013:<ul>
    <li>Added client-side option to hide game password in the game options area. This is useful for
    streaming the game and not letting people see the password. ;)</li>
    <li>Added option to "not use" the idle timer. In reality, it just sets it to about 25 days.</li>
    <li>Internal cleanups.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>30 March 2013:<ul>
    <li>Increased the game limit to 200.</li>
    <li>Tweaking other settings to attempt to increase stability with more than 550 users.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug where inactive card sets were showing. That was just something stupid on my end.
    </li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>27 March 2013:<ul>
    <li>The Third Expansion and the PAX East packs, as well as a few more custom cards.</li>
    <li>Card sets have a description when you hover over them in the options panel.</li>
    <li>Administrators can send messages that show up in every game chat, so I can do announcements
    that everybody will see.</li>
    <li>Increased the game limit to 125.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>25 February 2013:<ul>
    <li>Per-game chats. Finally. Global chat is still there. I hope to make it highlight the tab
    when there is activity at some point.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>9 January 2013:<ul>
    <li>New stylesheet from timsookram.</li>
    <li>New card sets. The Holiday Pack was added about a month ago, the MLP pack got lost in the
    server migration and has been restored, and another custom card set has been added from the fine
    folks over at Very Serious. This card set has a decent amount of in-jokes, though, so you may
    want to skip it for now. I'll pull out the universally funny cards later into another set.
      <ul><li>I haven't forgotten about the other card sets that have been sent in. I'll get to
      those later this week. I did this card set first since it was sent to me in a format that I
      could import directly into the database.</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>Plugged a hole that would let any especially crafty user pretend to be an administrator.
    This was done entirely at the firewall and web server level and required no code change to the
    game itself.</li>
    <li>Increased maximum game limit from 60 to 75.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>12 October, 5:00 AM UTC:<ul>
    <li>User Preferences. Click the button in the top-right corner and you can hide the connect
    and quit events, and ignore chat from specific users. These settings are remembered for the
    next time you play the game. The game also remembers what name you used last time you
    played.</li>
    <li>Games without a password will sort before games that do, so you can find them easier.</li>
    <li>Under-the-hood improvements.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Early September, 2012:<ul>
    <li>The Second Expansion has been entered.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>29 August, 6:00 AM UTC:<ul>
    <li>Chat flood protection. You may only chat 5 times in any given 15 second period.</li>
    <li>Splitting game chat out will happen next, this was just an easy bandage.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>21 August, 6:00 AM UTC:<ul>
    <li>Ban list. Only admins can ban.</li>
    <li>Chat from admins shows up in blue.</li>
    <li>
      Currently, the admin list contains just me and a close friend. I am not taking applications.
    </li>
    <li>Performance and stability tweaks.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>7 July, 10:00 PM UTC:<ul>
    <li>Proper Card Set support. Currently, only I can define the cards and card sets, but I hope to
    eventually let users define their own. This leads into the next item...</li>
    <li><strong>The First Expansion</strong>! Sorry it took so long, I've been quite busy with real
    work lately. Whenever The Second Expansion rolls around, it will be much easier for me to add
    since I've put in the proper structure to deal with card sets.</li>
    <li>I still haven't had time to separate out chat per-game, but that is the next thing on the
    to-do list.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>15 June, 2:00 AM UTC:<ul>
    <li>I haven't forgotten about this! The First Expansion cards are typed up (you probably have
    seen them accidentally showing up), I just need to make a proper way to choose what card decks
    to use in games. I will try to do that this weekend! In the mean time, I've removed the dummy
    marker cards you've also probably noticed from showing up (and also the First Expansion cards).
    </li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>23 March, 7:00 AM UTC:<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/ajanata/PretendYoureXyzzy/commit/368e890c07d29e1b810821ac6f76c983227ab7c1">
        Fixed a deadlock which caused the server to grind to a halt occasionally.</a> At least, I
    fixed one deadlock. I looked over the code a bit more closely to see if there were any other
    potential deadlocks, and didn't see any. I did go ahead and rework some of the other code to
    make it less likely. Hopefully this will fix the problems with the server randomly crapping
    out.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/ajanata/PretendYoureXyzzy/commit/bc4f0818f18f106e92590c4510210fc28847ef58">
      Fixed the chat log in Opera.</a></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>19 March, 4:20 AM UTC:<ul>
    <li>Added game passwords.</li>
    <li>Added Show Game Options button in-game to see the game's options. The host cannot change
    options while the game is in progress.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>18 March, 6:40 PM UTC:<ul>
    <li>Added version 1.2 Cards Against Humanity cards. Game host can choose between original, new,
    or both at once.<ul>
      <li>Cards that were slightly reworded in the new version were updated instead of replaced
      here, so even if you pick original you may get some newly reworded cards.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Hopefully fixed a rare crashing issue.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>17 March, 1:30 AM UTC:<ul>
    <li>Fixed AFK timer skipping people who played at least one card for a multiple-PICK card.</li>
    <li>Increased AFK timeouts to 45 + 15 * PICK seconds and 40 + 7 * PICK * PLAYERS seconds.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>17 March, Midnight UTC:<ul>
    <li>Initial AFK timer support added. This will skip (or kick, if there are not enough players) a
    player that takes longer than 15 + 15 * PICK seconds to play, or skip a judge that takes longer
    than 20 + 5 * PICK * PLAYERS seconds to select a winner. If a player is idle for two consecutive
    rounds, they will be kicked from the game. All of these numbers are adjustable; if the timeouts
    are too long or too short, please let me know!</li>
    <li>The game host can specify the Awesome Point goal from 4 to 10.</li>
    <li>The game host can specify the maximum number of players in a game from 3 to 10.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>
